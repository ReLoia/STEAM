# Website for the project STEAM2022

### This is the website I did for the STEAM project of 2022, I've worked on it only for 12 hours

yeah, I know it's not that cool, but I preferred hanging out those days to try to reduce my introversion rather than staying three days on the PC

In short the MIUR (ministry of education) did a project in 2021/2022 where students from participating schools competed in teams of 5/6. 
The challenge was to create a solution or an idea to solve a problem that the judge gave 3 day before the end of the competition 

I don't even know why I'm writing this, nobody is gonna read it
